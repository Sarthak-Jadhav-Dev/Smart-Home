      <!-- Introduction -->
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Household automation is rapidly evolving due to advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded systems. The integration of smart systems and artificial intelligence has transformed home automation, making daily life more convenient, secure, and energy-efficient. Traditional home control methods, such as manual door and window operation, can be inefficient and inconvenient. Automated home systems address these issues by responding dynamically to environmental changes, enhancing security, optimizing energy use, and improving user comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          This system continuously monitors various environmental indicators such as  rainfall, and fire hazards. If rain is detected, the windows close automatically to prevent water damage. When indoor temperatures rise, the system opens windows to promote natural ventilation, reducing the need for artificial cooling. In the event of a fire, doors and windows open automatically to release smoke and provide an escape route for occupants alomg with dedicated buzzers for every situiation.

      <!-- Methodology -->
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>
          The automated window and door system is organized in terms of a clearly defined block diagram that shows how different hardware and software modules interact with each other. The system contains environmental sensors like rain sensors,  and fire detection modules, which continuously measure conditions and report data to the Arduino microcontroller. The microcontroller calculates this data and decides whether to activate actuators such as servo motors to move doors and windows appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
          The software component entails writing code for the microcontroller utilizing the Arduino IDE, where predefined conditions and rules of automation are pre-programmed. A remote-access web-based interface allows for remote monitoring, overriding system operations manually, and viewing historical trends of the environment.

      <!-- Results -->
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          The prototype developed was able to successfully automate windows and doors according to environmental conditions. The system enhances energy efficiency by varying air circulation according to temperature changes and safety by offering automated responses to fire incidents. In testing, the system effectively sensed rain and fire threats, adjusting the openings accordingly in a timely manner. The web-based interface facilitated remote user intervention when needed, making the system user-friendly and highly responsive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rain sensor was found to have high accuracy in automatically closing windows within  seconds. The temperature and humidity sensor accurately controlled indoor climate conditions, minimizing unnecessary air conditioning use and boosting energy efficiency. Fire detection was very reliable, with the fire sensor responding in  seconds, causing doors and windows to open automatically for quick evacuation.
