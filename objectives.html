    <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <!-- Objective 1 -->
      <div class="objective-card">
        <h3>1. Enhance Safety and Security</h3>
        <p>
          The primary objective of this project is to enhance the safety and security of homes and commercial buildings. By integrating fire detection modules and emergency response features, the system ensures quick evacuation during fire hazards. Additionally, the system automatically closes windows during rain or other harsh weather conditions to prevent water damage.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Objective 2 -->
      <div class="objective-card">
        <h3>2. Improve Energy Efficiency</h3>
        <p>
          The system aims to optimize energy consumption by automatically adjusting windows and doors based on environmental conditions. For example, windows open to allow natural ventilation when indoor temperatures rise, reducing the need for artificial cooling systems. This contributes to energy savings and promotes sustainability.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Objective 3 -->
      <div class="objective-card">
        <h3>3. Provide Convenience and Automation</h3>
        <p>
          The project focuses on making daily life more convenient by automating the operation of windows and doors. Users no longer need to manually adjust windows or doors in response to changing weather conditions. The system also offers a web-based interface for remote monitoring and control, adding an extra layer of convenience.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Objective 4 -->
      <div class="objective-card">
        <h3>4. Promote Synchro Home Integration</h3>
        <p>
          Another key objective is to promote the integration of this system with other smart home technologies. By using IoT  solutions, the system can work seamlessly with other smart devices, such as lighting and security systems, to create a fully automated and interconnected living environment.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Objective 5 -->
      <div class="objective-card">
        <h3>5. Ensure Scalability and Compatibility</h3>
        <p>
          The project aims to design a system that is scalable and compatible with existing smart home infrastructures. This ensures that the system can be easily expanded or integrated with future technologies, making it a long-term solution for modern homes and buildings.
